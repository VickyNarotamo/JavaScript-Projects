JS Projects

These are some of the small projects I made using JavaScript.

Projects:
Pizza Menu,
Tic Tac Toe Game,
Calculator

Pizza Menu
The task involves creating a pizza ordering menu that offers a diverse range of toppings. The menu will allow users to select their desired toppings, and once the information is input, the system will automatically calculate the total price for the order.

Tic Tac Toe Game
The project entails developing a classic game of tic-tac-toe. To determine the starting player, the system employs random dice rolls. Once the players are selected, they engage in the traditional tic-tac-toe game. Users have the freedom to choose their preferred tokens for each player. Upon determining the winner, the celebration includes music and flashing lights.

Calculator
The project involves creating a sleek web version of a basic 4-function calculator. Users have the capability to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations using this user-friendly interface.

The project includes various challenges and tasks that serve as opportunities to explore and learn about JavaScript functions. Throughout these exercises, I engage with different concepts and enhance my understanding of JavaScript functionality.
